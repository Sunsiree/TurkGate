        <h3>Welcome to TurkGate.</h3>

        <p>TurkGate, or Grouping and Access Tools for External surveys (for use with Amazon Mechanical Turk), is a simple library that enables better control of access to external surveys. TurkGate was created for the purpose of conducting psychological experiments. As such, it provides easy-to-use, research-oriented features not included with Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

        <h3>What does TurkGate do?</h3>

        <p>TurkGate comprises three major features:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Assigning surveys to groups</li>
          <li>Restricting survey previews</li>
          <li>Verifying survey completion</li>
        </ol>

        <p>First and foremost, TurkGate allows you to group HITs together, such that workers may only access one survey within a group. As soon as a worker has accessed a survey in a particular group, they are denied future access to any survey in the same group. In certain research settings, allowing a participant to access similar surveys (e.g., different versions of a study) is unacceptable. Amazon Mechanical Turk does not offer a solution for this problem.</p>

        <p>Likewise, exposing workers to parts of your survey (e.g., previews) prematurely may invalidate results. TurkGate enables the absolute restriction of survey previews. It also prevents workers from returning to a survey (even if they closed it accidentally).</p>

        <p>Finally, TurkGate provides a method for assigning completion codes to workers. Rather than using a static (i.e., insecure) code, TurkGate generates dynamic and encrypted codes that can later be validated automatically.</p>

        <h3>How does TurkGate Work?</h3>

        <p>TurkGate provides requesters with templates for using Mechanical Turk via the web interface <em>or</em> the command line tools. After performing a web-based installation, TurkGate initializes a database on your server to track workers, HITs, and groups.</p>
